Hello Mr. Klipa,

I just realized that in my first Statistics program submission, I forgot to comment out the ID Sort line in my main method.
(It was there because I needed to sort by ID to test the second program.)  The program will still run the same way since
I was sorting by test scores after the ID sort, but I just wanted to let you know why that extra line was there.

Thanks,
Ziya Xu
